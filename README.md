# Use of machine learning to achieve stable and accurate simulations of the atmosphere

Here we provide codes that were used in the [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03151).
The codes are divided to three main libraries:
- sam_code: It is Fortran code with all changes done to SAM in our simulations. 
- RF_training_code: python code used for creating all RFs used in the manuscript. 
- high_res_processing_code: matlab code used to calculate the coarse-grained and resolved tendencies
